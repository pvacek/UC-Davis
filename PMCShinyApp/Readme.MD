#PMC Shiny App

This is the application I wrote with R's "shiny" package for the Predictive Modeling Competition for iidata. If you want to make your own version of the application, you will need to change two important aspects of the code. First off, you will need to change the testvector on the 5th line of code in "server.R". You will also need to use your own dropbox account, and save your token as a file called "token.rda". I used shinyapps.io to upload the application, as long as you do everything mentioned here, the application should work fine!
